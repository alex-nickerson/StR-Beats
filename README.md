# StR Beats

A React + Vite App to display my music: beats!




## Features

- Display beats fully using jsx
- Download beats via download button
- Automatically draws waveform based on the audio file provided
- Playing and seeking through beats via custom controls and by clicking on the waveform
- Custom audio controls to control the volume
- Current time of playing beat provided and updates accordingly
- Backend SQL integration via [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- User authentication via login page; handled by Supabase authentication
- Beats can only be added by authenticated users, and are updated to the database when added


## Lessons Learned

Through this project I learned more about building react applications (this time using Vite + React), and how to connect an app to a database (using Supabase). I faced many challenges like how to upload files to the database, how to authenticate users, and even how to simply connect to the database in the beginning. I have learned valuable skills in Frontend + Backend integration, such as uploading data to a backend database (In this case, an SQL database), and retreiving said data to display it and interact with it (in the form of beats).
